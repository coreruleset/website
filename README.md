# CRS Project Website Repository
[![Check Links](https://github.com/coreruleset/website/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coreruleset/website/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This repository contains the website for the OWASP CRS Project.

## For users of the CRS

The generated website is automatically updated at https://coreruleset.org/. If you intend to _contribute_ to the website, the rest of this page will guide you through it.

## Requirements

You can edit the documentation on your local system. You will need:
- the latest [Hugo binary](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for your OS (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for installing dependencies
- [dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) for transpiling to CSS

**Important: You need a modern version of Hugo, _extended_ version >= 0.123.0.**

## Cloning this repository

After getting hugo, just clone this repository to work locally. This way you can edit and verify quickly that everything is working properly before creating a new pull request.

To clone, use the *recursive* option so you will be getting also the theme to render the pages properly:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:coreruleset/website.git
```

We use two subrepos:
- the theme
- the documentation subrepo, which is built with a different theme

If you just want to edit documentation (not the website), you can do it in the [documentation repo](https://github.com/coreruleset/documentation/)

## Editing locally

You will need:
- hugo binary
- nodejs (for generating css files)

Then do:
```sh
‚ùØ npm install

added 205 packages, and audited 206 packages in 13s

57 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

Now you have all in place to perform your local edits.

Everything is created using markdown, and you will normally use the `content` subdirectory to add your edits.

The theme has shortcodes that can be used to simplify editing. You can get more information about it on [Hugo Dot-Org theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/dot-org-hugo-theme/).

You can run `hugo` to serve the pages, and while you edit and save, your changes will be refreshed in the browser!

Use:
```
hugo serve
```

Then check your edits on http://localhost:1313/.

## Online Preview

Any merged updates are pushed to [coreruleset.github.io](coreruleset.github.io/website/) for preview.

## Authors

Because users are `git` users now (there is no user "logged"), there is a [mapping between authors and github users](https://github.com/coreruleset/website/blob/main/data/authors.yaml). If you want to collaborate, please add your github username as the key, and your data below. See the examples in that file.

## Sending changes for review

Once you are happy with your local changes, please send a PR.
