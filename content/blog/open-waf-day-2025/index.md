After coming back from Barcelona, it took me a bit to adjust to my normal timezone. It took me a while to just get my head on this post.

First of all, we would like to thank again our Open WAF day Barcelona 2025 sponsor, [Harness](https://www.harness.io/) :clap: :clap: :clap: Without them setting this up would have been extremely difficult.

Now, we had around 20 people stopping by in our assigned room at the magnific CCIB. The agenda ended up being:
