Are you interested in hanging out with the CRS developers? Giving your input on CRS development issues? Chatting about the wonderful world of WAFs? Then this is your chance!

At OWASP AppSecEU 2018, we have started the **\#coreruleset** channel in the OWASP Slack.

This has turned out to be a good place for exchanging ideas and working together in real time. So, we've settled in and we invite anyone to join us there.

To join:

1. Go to <https://owasp.org/slack/invite>
2. Register with your e-mail address.
3. When in the Slack, find our channel in the channel list, or simply type: <tt>/join #coreruleset</tt>

From now on, we will hold our monthly development meetings in the Slack channel (first Monday of every month).

See you there!

PS: for CRS/ModSecurity help questions, we prefer that you use public forums such as the [CRS mailing list](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set) or StackOverflow. This will ensure that your question and the answers will be searchable, so that others can also learn from them. Thank you!
