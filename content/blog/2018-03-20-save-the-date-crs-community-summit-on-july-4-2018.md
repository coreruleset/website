title: 'Save the Date: CRS Community Summit on July 4, 2018'
---


The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set project will meet on Wednesday July 4, at 4pm in London to hold it's first community summit. We scheduled this for the night before the AppSecEU conference in London on Thursday and Friday so people would have a real incentive to make the trip.

Truth be told, the three project leads, Chaim, Walter and me have never met in person and physical contact is similarly rare between the committers, let alone the commercial suppliers or the thousands of users worldwide.

So what's the plan?

- Let's meet and you tell us how you use CRS in your setup!
- Let's talk about the status of the project, the road map and your feature requests!
- Let's start to build strong ties within the community!

We will reserve 2-3 hours for this exchange of thoughts. Afterwards, we plan to go out and have dinner together with you.

We would like to keep the administrative overhead relatively low. But OWASP needs us to do a prior registration for our community meeting so they can assign the right room size for us.

This will all be sorted out in due time, but for the time being, please save the date, spread the word about this meeting and schedule your absence with your boss (if that is necessary)!

Best regards,

Christian
