“With child-friendly breaks for families of all ages, there’s something for everyone on a Center Parcs break. Discover the forest and enjoy precious family time together in our picturesque lodges,” reads the description on the Center Parcs website. Does this also apply to open source projects? The OWASP CRS project is about to find out, as the CRS core team is meeting from November 1st to 8th for the annual developer retreat at the [Woburn Forest site](https://www.centerparcs.co.uk/discover-center-parcs/holiday-locations/woburn-forest.html) of this traditional British institution for young family holidays.

We chose this location because OWASP is holding its [Project Summit 2024](https://owaspprojectsummit.org) there at the same time, from November 4-8. This will allow us to meet with members of other projects under the OWASP umbrella, while coming together as a team for interesting and necessary [discussions](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Dev-Retreat-2024-Topics).

Among the topics we discussed were.

-	[Roadmap 2024-25](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Dev-Retreat-Roadmap-2024%E2%80%902025)
-	[Quantitative testing](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Discussion-Quantitative-Testing)
-	LTS (more details probably coming soon)
-	[New CRS rule language](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Workshop:-Updates-on-new-CRS-Language)
-	[ReDoS](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/ReDOS-working-session-2024)
-	[Rule documentation](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/wiki/Rule-documentation-2024)

Expect more detailed news on some of these in the coming days, weeks, or probably months.

On Sunday, the team skipped work and took a trip to nearby Bletchley Park, the Mecca for code breakers, hackers, and cybersecurity experts. And for radio enthusiasts, as the team soon found out how hard it can be to get Airween away from the National Radio Centre...

Much of the rest of the time is hard work on various week-long projects, watched through the windows by curious squirrels and deer.
