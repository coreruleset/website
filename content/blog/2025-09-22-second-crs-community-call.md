title: 'Second CRS community call'

We're excited to announce our second community call, taking place on September 22, 2025. Although our first call did not match the expectitions we had for it (primarily with respect to the number of participants), we are still pretty happy with the outcome. It was a good experience for all attendees to get to know each other and chat about CRS. So we decided to give it another go and see what will happen.

## Program

The program will be similar to last time, with Christian Folini hosting the event:
- Christian talks shop
- Meet the devs and other users
- Dedicated time reserved for your questions

In the last segment, we want to give you time to ask any questions, be it CRS basics like default configuration, advanced topics like rule exclusions, or questions about rule development and tooling.

## When And Where
