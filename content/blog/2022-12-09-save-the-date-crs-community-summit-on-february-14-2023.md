title: 'Save the Date: CRS Community Summit on February 14, 2023'
---


Let the CRS project be your Valentine: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set   
project will hold the first post-pandemic Community Summit at the Dublin   
Convention Center in Ireland on Tuesday, February 14, 2023.

We invite the whole CRS community, users, developers, integrators, and sponsors  
to meet with us for an exchange of thoughts, technical talks, and networking.   
After the “official” part of the meeting we will go out for dinner and drinks.

The date was chosen on purpose: The [OWASP 2023 Global App Sec conference](https://dublin.globalappsec.org)  
starts at the same location on February 15.

More information and the program will be available in due time. For the   
moment, please save the date and spread the word!

Cheers,  
Christian, Felipe, Walter
