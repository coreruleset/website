title: 'First CRS community call'
author: theseion

CRS is the world's leading open source WAF rule set. A very large part of this success is thanks to our amazing community who report problems with the rules and tell us about real world issues they experience. Due to its nature, CRS is also quite complex and first (or even second) contact with using CRS can be quite daunting. We constantly try to reduce the level of complexity: we want make it _easier_ for people to start working with CRS.

## Community Calls

We were recently inspired by the [SAMM project](https://owaspsamm.org): they regularly organize moderated video chats with their community where they talk about project updates and answer questions. We think that this kind of interaction might help newcomers and might also interest more seasoned CRS users, so we want to give it a shot. Our first community call, which will be a trial run, will take place on **Monday 17 March** and will be moderated by former CRS co-leader Christian Folini (yes, he wrote [the book](https://www.feistyduck.com/books/modsecurity-handbook/)). We have the following program planned:
- CRS news users need to know
- How we build the rules
- Meet the devs and other users
- Dedicated time reserved for your questions

In the last segment, we want to give you time to ask any questions, be it CRS basics like default configuration, advanced topics like rule exclusions, or questions about rule development and tooling.

## When And Where

The first community call will take place on **March 17, from 20:30 to 21:30 CET** (19:30 UTC / 2:30 p.m. ET). Head over to the [registration page](/registration/community-call) to grab the link to the call.

We're looking forward to seeing some old and, hopefully, many new faces :wave:.
