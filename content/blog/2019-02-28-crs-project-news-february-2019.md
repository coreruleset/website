title: CRS Project News February 2019
---

We are back with the CRS project news. The news are running very, very late in the month as I've been held up with other projects.

### What has happened in recent weeks

- Miyuru Sankalpa has started to publish a transformed GeoIP database in the legacy format readable by ModSecurity 2.x under a creative commons. This seems to be based on the MaxMind databases and it is not clear of MaxMind endorses this initiative.

- CRS developer Andrea Menin has released a set of ModSecurity rules that complement CRS when protecting WordPress.

- Andrea Menin has also written a tutorial about DNS over HTTPS and how to protect and integrate it using ModSecurity.

- Microsoft has forked ModSecurity 2.x on github and it is (according sombody working on the project) working on patches that allow better integration with the Azure Cloud.

- CRS developer Franziska BÃ¼hler has integrated CRS together with the Pixie learning app into a new docker container. This allows for easy training sessions and checking out attacks against the naked Pixie and the one protected by CRS.

### Things that are meant to happen in the coming weeks or thereafter

- Swiss Post is runing a public intrusion against its Online-Voting system, that is protected by the Core Rule Set as a first layer of defense. The test runs from February 25 to March 24, 2019.
